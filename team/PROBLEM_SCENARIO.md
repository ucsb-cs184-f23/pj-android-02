# App Idea: 

An on-demand pickup and delivery service that connects buyers with people who are already close to the place the buyers want stuff from using a bounty board system.

# Problem Scenario: 

### As a buyer:

It's late at night and you want to order one or two items. It feels too far away to drive to and too late to walk or ride the bus there. You want to use DoorDash but they have an atrocious minimum price. You put up a bounty for some number of dollars to pick up your favorite chips. After some time someone drops them off and you give them money.

### As a deliverer:

It's late at night and you're getting off work or you had the munchies and you happened to be at some store. You check the bounty board before hopping in your car to see if you can make a few dollars on your way home. You see a bounty, select it, and buy the goods. You're on your way home and drop off the item and get paid for it.
