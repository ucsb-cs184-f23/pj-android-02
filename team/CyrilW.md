Hi, my name is Cyril Wang and I am a 4th year CS student, originally from the Bay Area. In my free time, I enjoy reading or playing sports with my friends.

I do not have much experience with mobile app development (only a little dabbling in Android Studio and android apps), which is why I'm excited to take this class. Looking forward to learning more about android development!
