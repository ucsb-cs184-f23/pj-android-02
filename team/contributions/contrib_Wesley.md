## Wesley Kam

My contributions involved a lot of planning and implementing features that pertained to user usability. Some of the features I implemented consisted of the hustler's view of the job board, allowing the requester and hustler to communicate vaguely, and adding notifications so that the requester gets updates regarding the completion of their request. I also created the design flow for the app.

Some of the notable PR's that I worked on were [Notifications on Status Change](https://github.com/ucsb-cs184-f23/pj-android-02/pull/112), [Wk - Extra Status Buttons](https://github.com/ucsb-cs184-f23/pj-android-02/pull/107), and [Job Details Page Update](https://github.com/ucsb-cs184-f23/pj-android-02/pull/94)
