# Team Contributions

## Dylan:

My contributions include contributing code, ideation, UI design, and deployment. Of my code contributions, the main things I worked on were 
authentication, the current job page and its related parts in the request form and job board, and reviewing PRs. I also took part in a lot of 
UI changes and logic mishaps. Aside from code contributions, I was often the scribe and also created the user manual for the app.

The notable PRs I worked on were implementing authentication, creating the current job page, allowing job cancellation and completion, and allowing multiple current jobs.

## Cyril:

My contributions revolved around our app's interaction with the database. These included setting up our Firebase database for us to write our data to, the 
dynamic updating and pulling of data from the database to the job board, creating navigation components for the various pages, other related database issues, 
any UI issues that arose, and implementing the current request page (although that ended up not being merged to main).

In addition, I led and contributed to various team meetings, such as retros, sprint plannings, as well as scribing for scrums often. Also worked on the evaluation
part for our app, getting feedback for our app and what to improve upon. 

For the most part, the contributors graph appears to be ok. One concern is mainly the uneven spread of contributions over the quarter, 
with my graph being heavily weighted towards the earlier parts of the quarter. I believe this is because I made more important contributions 
earlier in the quarter (such as the realtime, dynamic updating of the job board from the database), and it is also because some of my contributions 
later in the quarter were not merged due to duplicating issues, not having enough time to make it satisfactory (specifically testing), or running out 
of time before the code freeze. But overall, think that the contributions graph is fairly accurate beyond those things.

## Hanson:

My contribution to the team involved organizing teeam efforts, generating new feature ideas, and implementing new features. 
As for code contribution, I made consistent contributions that directly tied into new app functionality/features that worked with existing UI and code.

## Wesley:

My contributions involved a lot of planning and implementing features that pertained to user usability. Some of the features I implemented consisted of the 
hustler's view of the job board, allowing the requester and hustler to communicate vaguely, and adding notifications so that the requester gets 
updates regarding the completion of their request. I also created the design flow for the app.

## Luke:
DISCLAIMER: I ended up pushing code from three different accounts to GitHub (I somehow rarely used my actual uscb account), 
so my contributions graph covers only a small fraction of my total committed code.

Throughout this project, I was solely responsible for the UI and the design of our app. 
To this end, I designed and implemented our app's logo, splash screen, color schemes, and UI layouts for virtually every page. 
Other feature implementations I was responsible for were allowing users to set default preferences (address, numbers, etc) on first login and edit 
preferences in the future, adding form validations, improving database retrievals and puts, and allowing users to rate and see their requesters/hustlers ratings.

Aside from code contributions, I also helped the team with ideation and discussions and led our scrum meetings.
