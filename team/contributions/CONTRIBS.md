My contributions involved a lot of planning and implementing features that pertained to user usability. Some of the features I implemented consisted of the hustler's view of the job board, allowing the requester and hustler to communicate vaguely, and adding notifications so that the requester gets updates regarding the completion of their request. I also created the design flow for the app. The contribution graphs are consistent with the work that I put in, although some issues required a lot of learning like figuring out notifications.
