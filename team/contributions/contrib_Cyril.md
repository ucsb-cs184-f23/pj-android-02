For the most part, the contributors graph appears to be ok. One concern is mainly the uneven spread of contributions over the quarter, with my graph being heavily 
weighted towards the earlier parts of the quarter. I believe this is because I made more important contributions earlier in the quarter (such as the realtime, dynamic
updating of the job board from the database), and it is also because some of my contributions later in the quarter were not merged due to duplicating issues, not having
enough time to make it satisfactory (specifically testing), or running out of time before the code freeze. But overall, think that the contributions graph is fairly 
accurate beyond those things.
