# Dylan's Contributions

My contributions include contributing code, ideation, UI design, and deployment. Of my code contributions, the main things I worked on were authentication, the current job page and its related parts in the request form and job board, and reviewing PRs. I also took part in a lot of UI changes and logic mishaps. Aside from code contributions, I was often the scribe and also created the user manual for the app.

The notable PRs I worked on were [implementing authentication](https://github.com/ucsb-cs184-f23/pj-android-02/pull/14), [creating the current job page](https://github.com/ucsb-cs184-f23/pj-android-02/pull/43), [allowing job cancellation and completion](https://github.com/ucsb-cs184-f23/pj-android-02/pull/55), and [allowing multiple current jobs](https://github.com/ucsb-cs184-f23/pj-android-02/pull/114).
