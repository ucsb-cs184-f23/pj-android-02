### Contributions

DISCLAIMER: I ended up pushing code from three different accounts to GitHub (I somehow rarely used my actual uscb account), so my 
contributions graph covers only a small fraction of my total committed code.

Throughout this project, I was solely responsible for the UI and the design of our app. To this end, I designed and implemented 
our app's logo, splash screen, color schemes, and UI layouts for virtually every page. Other feature implementations I was responsible for 
were allowing users to set default preferences (address, numbers, etc) on first login and edit preferences in the future, adding form 
validations, improving database retrievals and puts, and allowing users to rate and see their requesters/hustlers ratings.

Aside from code contributions, I also helped the team with ideation and discussions and led our scrum meetings.
