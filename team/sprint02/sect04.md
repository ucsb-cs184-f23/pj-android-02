Hanson finished accept button PR, added some routing to the main activity page, made it so user selection routes to other pages now.

Wesley created PR for submitting jobs to database, merged Dylan's PR.

Cyril updated job board so that it pulls the jobs from the database and updates the current job list. Will work on implementing a way to navigate between pages. 

Dylan made the current job page and reviewed some PRs.

Luke finished editing our logo and made the splash screen for the app when the app is launched. Added image assests to replace default images and the app icon.
