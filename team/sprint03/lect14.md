Type of Meeting: Daily Scrum

Meeting time: lect09

Team: Dylan Chung [x], Hanson Yu [x], Wesley Kam [x], Cyril Wang [x], Luke Li [x]

Scribed Discussion:

Hanson is working on getting the expiration time slider set up in the request form and figuring out how to make jobs auto cancel when the time is up.

Dylan approved a PR and created a simple design document.

Luke started working on default info page.

Wesley worked on reformatting on the job detail page.

Cyril updated the Firebase database rules and updated the nav menu to change based on different user roles.

We looked through all of the feedback and realized that there are a few inconveniences when it comes to requesting. This resulted in several new user stories for requesters:

- As a requester, I want to be able to create requests more easily to satisfy my immediate cravings.
- As a requester, I want to see a history of my past orders in my profile, so that I can easily reference or reorder items.
- As a requester, I want to integrate digital payment options like Venmo or Cashapp into the app, so that I can make payments easily and securely.

For hustlers:

- As hustler / deliverer, I want to maximize my profits per trip and make the process as seamless as possible.
- As a hustler, I want a clearer job board layout, so that I can easily identify the most important information about each request, like location, item list, and payment.
- As a hustler, I want the ability to share my real-time location with requesters once I accept a job, so they can track the progress of their order.
