MVP Feedback Review

We looked through all of the feedback and realized that there are a few inconveniences when it comes to requesting. This resulted in several new user stories for requesters:

As a requester, I want to be able to create requests more easily to satisfy my immediate cravings.

As a requester, I want to see a history of my past orders in my profile, so that I can easily reference or reorder items.

As a requester, I want to integrate digital payment options like Venmo or Cashapp into the app, so that I can make payments easily and securely.

For hustlers:

As hustler / deliverer, I want to maximize my profits per trip and make the process as seamless as possible.

As a hustler, I want a clearer job board layout, so that I can easily identify the most important information about each request, like location, item list, and payment.

As a hustler, I want the ability to share my real-time location with requesters once I accept a job, so they can track the progress of their order.

Parking Lot:

Luke will review Cyril Evaluation
Dylan will review Luke Implementation
Cyril will review Dylan Documentation
Wesley will review Hanson Implementation
Hanson will review Wesley Design
