# Date of Retrospective: 10/20/23

* Led by: Cyril Wang
* Present: EVERYONE
* Absent: NO ONE

## Action items

Goals:
* One thing that our team wanted to get better at is keeping the kanban board up-to-date. We noticed that sometimes that issues weren't being moved into their proper
  columns and finished issues weren't being closed.
* Another goal that we have is to write better issue descriptions and better PR descriptions. We find that it can be hard to understand what other people have worked
  or implemented recently and one way that we thought would help would be to have better documentation so that users won't have to spend extensive time testing changes
  or reading code. 
  
Changes:
* One thing that we wanted to change was to allocate a certain amount of time each class / team meeting to discuss new ideas or any concerns that team members may
  have. We felt that have some time to brainstorm and reflect on the direction of the app would be beneficial in the long-run, to make sure that our app is going in
  the right direction.

Measurement:
* One way to measure that issues are being closed properly is to check the number of unclosed issues in the done column of the kanban board.
* One way to measure that we are taking time to discuss new ideas and concerns is if they are being documented in the scrum meetings.
* One way to measure that we are writing more descriptive PRs is if our PRs descriptions have more sentences.

## Retro Assessment

We used the start-stop-continue retro, where each person wrote down things that we wanted to start doing, stop doing, and continue doing. Then we voted on issues that we thought were most pressing and brainstormed ideas on how we could address those things. 

Retro went well, there was not as much stuff to discuss as we've only been a team for a week or two. That being said, there were still things that we noticed should be addressed and had solid discussion on how to approach that.

Advice:
* Don't be afraid to call on specific people to talk if no one is sharing.
* Keep team focused and on-track
* Let other team members speak first before giving your opinion
