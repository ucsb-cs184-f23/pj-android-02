# Date of Retrospective: 11/08/23

* Led by: Luke Li
* Present: everyone
* Absent: no one

## Action items

Goals:
* One thing that our team wants to do better is defining our issues more and stopping any more cases where a team member accidentally does another person's issues
  while working on a separate issue
* Another goal that we have is to stop breaking up our issues into smaller issues as much and leave each of them covering slightly more work.
  
Changes:
* One thing that our team wants to change is to get better at writing acceptance criteria for all of our issues so that code reviewers or other team members can understand
  better what an issue accomplishes and when its completed.

Measurement:
* One way to measure that issues aren't being broken up too much is to check the number of issues with a workload of "1" or "2" etc.
* One way to measure that we are defining issues better is seeing whether or not any team members accidentally do another person's issue in the future.
* One way to measure that we are writing more acceptance criteria for our issues is for code reviewers to actually check for criteria and notify the code reviewee if they didn't write any.

## Retro Assessment

We used the start-stop-continue retro, where each person wrote down things that we wanted to start doing, stop doing, and continue doing. Then we voted on issues that we thought were most pressing and brainstormed ideas on how we could address those things. 

Advice:
* Don't be afraid to call on specific people to talk if no one is sharing.
* Keep team focused and on-track
* Let other team members speak first before giving your opinion

## Retro Experiment Results

For defining issues better and keeping their scopes larger, we found that these two goals come hand in hand, as the larger an issue was, the less likely we found that team members' work overlap. Another thing that we found helpful was that when we wrote acceptance criteria when we created the issues, it was easier for team members to know what the issue entails, which made it easier to cut down on accidentally overlapping work (before, whoever worked on the issue had the freedom to work on however they thought that the issue meant, which obviously did not always align with what the team thought). We also found that it made it easier for testing, as the testers were able to have a clear checklist to work through when testing, rather than having to figure it out on their own. So we think that it will be a good idea to continue writing acceptance criteria and making our issues larger.
