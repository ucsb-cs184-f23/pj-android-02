The request duration feature was implemented by adding number pickers to the request form of the app that the user can use to select the duration of their request before it expires. Changes were made to the request form XML to add the UI and to the request form activity to implement the number picker functionality. The backend changes are made so that on render of the job board activity a check is done for all pending jobs so that only jobs with an expiration timestamp that is in the future are rendered. Changes were also made in the request from activity to add the expiration timestamp to the database.
