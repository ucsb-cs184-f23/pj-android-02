# HW 4

The contents of my hw4 are located in this branch: https://github.com/ucsb-cs184-f23/pj-android-02/tree/cwTestingHw4

Specifically, the tests are located in this path: pj-android-02/CouchPotatoes/app/src/androidTest/java/com/couchpotatoes. They contain frontend, UI tests that check to make sure that each activity is displaying the proper display that it is supposed to.
And can be run easily in the android studio ide by right clicking the AndroidTest folder and selecting the run tests option as seen below.

Located in this folder as well is `userfeedback.md`, which contains a list of things in our app that I thought of that could be improved or be taken in a different direction, or at least be brought up for debate either within our team or for an outside source to evaluate for us. It is not a comprehensive list, but things that I thought had more importance given the impending code freeze next week.
