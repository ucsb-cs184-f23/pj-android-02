# User feedback needs

1. Does the app make intuitive sense on how to use? (i.e. knowing the different roles, their features and purposes,

2. Would you want the deliverer to be able to have multiple jobs at once? Or limit it to just one at a time? Or a different limitation? (bc. don't want one user to be able to take all the listed jobs)

3. Does UI design look nice, is it visually appealing? 

4. Opinion on whether a user should be able to be both a requester and a deliverer? Should we limit a user to only one role? (for instance, if they have a request, they can't do deliveries; and vice versa, if they delivering things, they can't request things)

5. (not possible within the scope of this class) Would you want a "google maps" or "pokemon go" type interface? The vision for it is that you can see requests live on a map and where they are, as well as being able to create requests on the map.

6. Thoughts on having a live notification system, that sends a push notification when a request near you is created.
