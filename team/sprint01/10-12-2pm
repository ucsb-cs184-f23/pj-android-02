Everyone finished HW1 in creating a basic "Hello World" app.

Updated the README with everyone's name and github ID. Need to think of a team name together.

Cyril and Wesley were blocked before on connecting their android phones to android studio and being able to deploy their app to a physical device, but the issue has been solved now.

Dylan finished creating a problem scenario added it into the team folder under PROBLEM_SCENARIO.md.
