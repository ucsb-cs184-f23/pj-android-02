# Norms
* Try to show up to all meetings, and communicate if you can't
* Stay on top of things/ plan ahead, so that we have time if things go wrong
* Communicate often; keep each other updated on what you're doing
* Be nice to one another
* Do your best!
* If you’re stuck on something, type it into chat so everyone can think about it together
* Try to let people know at least 15 minutes ahead of time if you’re going to be late or miss something
* React to messages to indicate you are working on someone's message on Slack
