# Things we know and the things we plan to learn

### Dylan
I know a bit about web development and some AI applications. I know essentially no mobile development. I hope to learn more about the language Kotlin, as well as the steps required to develop an app and deploy it.

### Hanson

I have some experience in web development, mobile development using React Native, and embedded development. No experience in Kotlin or developing directly in the Android studio IDE which is what I hope to learn.
