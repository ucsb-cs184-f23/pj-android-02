# Things we know and the things we plan to learn

### Dylan
I know a bit about web development and some AI applications. I know essentially no mobile development. I hope to learn more about the language Kotlin, as well as the steps required to develop an app and deploy it.

### Hanson

I have some experience in web development, mobile development using React Native, and embedded development. No experience in Kotlin or developing directly in the Android studio IDE which is what I hope to learn.

### Luke
I've done work with web development and UI testing/QC on iOS (XCUITest) and Android (Espresso) apps. I'm looking to learn more about building mobile apps using Kotlin.

### Cyril
I am somewhat familiar with web development, and have played around with Android Studio before (used Java, not Kotlin). Looking forward to learning more about making mobile apps (especially more intricate and complex ones) and learning new languages like Kotlin.
