# Things we know and the things we plan to learn

### Dylan
I know a bit about web development and some AI applications. I know essentially no mobile development. I hope to learn more about the language Kotlin, as well as the steps required to develop an app and deploy it.

### Hanson

I have some experience in web development, mobile development using React Native, and embedded development. No experience in Kotlin or developing directly in the Android studio IDE which is what I hope to learn.

### Luke
I've done work with web development and UI testing/QC on iOS (XCUITest) and Android (Espresso) apps. I'm looking to learn more about building mobile apps using Kotlin.

### Cyril
I am somewhat familiar with web development, and have played around with Android Studio before (used Java, not Kotlin). Looking forward to learning more about making mobile apps (especially more intricate and complex ones) and learning new languages like Kotlin.

### Wesley
I have some experience in web development, most of which comes from CS148 and CS156. I do not have any experience with mobile development. I am hoping to learn how to develop mobile apps in Kotlin.

# Android / Kotlin Benefits and Challenges

### Benefits
1. Android Studio as an IDE (Streamlined UI design, Device emulator, etc...)
3. Compared to Java, Kotlin is much more concise
4. Multiplatform capabilities: Kotlin supports development for JavaScript, Android, Linux, Mac, Windows, and many other platforms.
5. Practical language to learn: Becoming more popular in industry and is considered the better option to learn than Java.

### Challenges
1. Not everyone has an Android device
2. Since Kotlin is relatively new, there are fewer resources to learn from. Java has a much larger user base.
3. All of us have to learn a new technology (little to no experience with Android and/or Kotlin)
4. Deciding which version of Android to support (older but more universal vs. newer but less devices can run)
