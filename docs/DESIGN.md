For this app, we are working with Kotlin in Android Native. 

For our frontend, we are just using the default components provided by Android.

For our backend, we are using Firebase to implement authentication and provide a realtime database for our users.

# Important Team Decisions

### sprint01/lect04

We decided that we wanted to pivot our app idea from a game discount app to a delivery service app. 

### spritn01/lect05

We decided on basic mockup of our app.

From here on out, we generally followed our guidelines up until the current moment.
