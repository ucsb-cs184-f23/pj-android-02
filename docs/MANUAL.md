# Introduction:

Couch Potatoes is a mobile app meant to simplify the user's ability to deliver goods, such as groceries, food, and other products, from stores on-demand and at a lower pricing than competing apps. Couch Potatoes is meant to be more convenient for both the deliverer and the requester.

Prices for delivery are not set by some default or by stores but rather individual users. Additionally, deliverers are intended to already be at the store, or perhaps wanting to go to the store but unwilling to go just to buy themselves something. By using Couch Potatoes, dashers have incentive to do the things they want while making money.

Requesters can request for any product from any location for a price that they set instead of the app. Dashers have access to a "bounty board"-like system that allows users to select jobs that they see as favorable.

# Intended Users:

### As a buyer:

It's late at night and you want to order one or two items. It feels too far away to drive to and too late to walk or ride the bus there. You want to use DoorDash but they have an atrocious minimum price. You put up a bounty for some number of dollars to pick up your favorite chips. After some time someone drops them off and you give them money.

### As a deliverer:

It's late at night and you're getting off work or you had the munchies and you happened to be at some store. You check the bounty board before hopping in your car to see if you can make a few dollars on your way home. You see a bounty, select it, and buy the goods. You're on your way home and drop off the item and get paid for it.

# Features and Functionality:

There are five main key features, two of which are tied to the role selected.

The first key feature, not tied to a specific role, is to look at your user profile. From here, you should be able to see all of your default information and your personal user information.

The second key feature, tied to requesters, is to request a job. From here, you can fill out the necessary details, what you want, where you want it from, where you want it delivered, how much you are willing to pay.

The third key feature, tied to hustlers, is to pick a job. There is a job bounty board that includes all available jobs. From here, you can select a job to see additional information. Once you are here, you can choose to select the job to complete.

The fourth key feature is the ability to see your current job. From the current job page, both as a requester and hustler, you can see the current job you are assigned. From here, you can choose to cancel the job or complete the job. If you are a requester, cancelling the job will remove the job from the job board. If you are a hustler, cancelling the job will remove the current job from your current job page and return it to the bounty board. If you are completing the job, it will disappear from your current job page.
