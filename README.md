## Couch Potatoes
A delivery app, where users can be both the deliverers and the ones getting delivered to. A response to the midnight cravings or the sudden realization of a forgetten grocery item, this app is meant for people to be able to put up a delivery request for a grocery item that they need but is not worth the effort to go all the way to the store. On the other hand, it's also meant for the people at the stores to accept requests and to deliver items for the requesters and make some quick cash.

## Tech Stack
For our tech stack, we are using the Android Studio IDE, Kotlin programming language, and Firebase database.

## Approach
Our approach is to create a basic basic delivery app, where users can make requests for items to be delivered and for other users to be able to accept those requests and deliver the items. Our goal is to forst create a viable product where the core functionality is present. Right now, the plan is to make something like a job board, where requests will be pop ups that contain specific details (such as the item, price, store, address, etc...) and deliverers will be able to accept those requests. After that, we plan on adding more complex features, such as an interactive map where requests will pop up at the location of the store, a rating system for users so users can know whether they are trustworthy or not, and hopefully a fleshed-out payment system. 

## User Roles
Requesters - Users that can request for items to be picked up and delivered to them. These users can create requests / jobs in the app that the deliverers can see and accept. 

Deliverers / "Hustlers" - Users that deliver the items to the requesters. These users can browse for open requests and accept the ones that are near to them.
